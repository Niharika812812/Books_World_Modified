# Books World - Modified (for MERN Fullstack Assignment)

This repository is a modified version that implements the assignment requirements: JWT authentication, book CRUD, reviews, pagination (5 per page), average rating calculations, and a React frontend.

## Structure
- backend/  -> Express + Mongoose API
- frontend/ -> React app (Bootstrap)

Follow README files inside backend and frontend for setup instructions.

Good luck â€” if you'd like, I can further enhance UI, add search/filter, charts, or prepare a Postman collection and deployment configs.
